# Illumination Normalization

Code developed based on the technique proposed by Chen et al (2006). Full article: [Illumination Compensation and Normalization for Robust Face Recognition Using Discrete Cosine Transform in Logarithm Domain](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~if751/projetos/artigos/Illumination%20Compensation%20and%20Normalization%20for%20Robust%20Face%20Recognition%20Using%20Discrete%20Cosine%20Transform%20in%20Logarithm%20Domain.pdf).
